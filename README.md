ðŸŒ± I graduated from Tech Elevator Philadelphia, where I had the opportunity to experience agile work with teams, build backend and frontend applications, design and implement a RESTful API and a PostgreSQL database.
Skills:
Java  âˆ™  PostgreSQL  âˆ™  Spring Boot âˆ™  Unit Testing (JUnit)  âˆ™  HTML  âˆ™  CSS  âˆ™  JavaScript  âˆ™  Vue.js   âˆ™  Responsive Design   âˆ™  JSON   âˆ™  Git   âˆ™  IntelliJ 
ðŸ”­ My team's capstone projects included: TEnmo â€“ an online payment and money transfer service and Ninja Flashcards - a Quizlet-like application for study cards, implementing a RESTful API MVC design and a PostgreSQL database, and Vue.js.

I have always loved learning, so it is no surprise that I am not just pulled in a single direction, but am drawn to both science and visual arts. I did a doctorate in image engineering and neuroscience (visual perception) researching human vision and especially the mechanisms underlying visual processing of lightness, constrast, as well as the processing of balance in a composition, the role of the elements in the visual field and of attention in forming balance perception.  
My multidisciplinary background enables me to ask novel questions and to think out-of-the-box in many different ways. I am bringing all of that into software development.

âš¡ Fun fact: I practiced Japanese calligraphy for 13 years and love ancient manuscripts of Japanese poetry, zen and green tea.
